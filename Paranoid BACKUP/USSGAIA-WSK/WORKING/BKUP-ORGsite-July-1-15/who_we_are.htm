<h1>Who we are</h1>
<br />United Space Structures is a development, design and construction company that will operate in earth's orbit building the future's largest structures. We are in development of several robotic platforms that will have the capability to build a double walled structure that is cylindrical in shape and measuring 100 meters in diameter by 400 meters in length. This is a medium size structure that will produce 2.8 million cubic meters of habitable interior volume. In comparison, the interior volume of the International Space Station when completed will be 1,000 cubic meters.<br /><br />Utilizing our FESSS technology for building large cylindrical space structures, the dream of a large habitable environment with variable gravity is technically and economically possible.<br /><br /><span class="black_head">United Space Structures' design for the first structures will be called: Gaia Class<br /><br />United Space Structures intends to start a space revolution. We are looking for partners.<br /><br />Do you have the right stuff? Join us!</span> <br /><br /></div>

<h2>Bill Kemp<br />CEO</h2>
Founder of the FESSS space construction process, patent pending. Bill has 30 years experience in all fields of architecture and engineering, designing and managing projects ranging from $600 million to $27 billion. His primary design focus has been data centers and command centers with redundant engineering systems and blast hardened. Bill's greatest strength is coordinating large fast track projects that require complex state-of-the-art multi-discipline design engineering process. Managing projects with effective communication and coordination during a very dynamic design process was accomplished through Bill's delegation of responsibility and building of teams which are inter-reliant with each other.</div>
