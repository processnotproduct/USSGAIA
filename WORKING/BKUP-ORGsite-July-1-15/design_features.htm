<h1>Design Features of United Space Structures Habitats</h1>
<br />
<h2>Artificial Gravity</h2>
The design of the structure allows for the creation of a variable artificial gravity by spinning the cylinder about its long axis. This feature will allow for long duration flights without the disabling effects of muscle and bone loss due to zero gravity. Physiologically and psychologically, the environment will be easier to adapt to than zero gravity.<br /><br />
<h2>Cosmic Radiation Protection</h2>
The double wall system of the structure's inner and outer hull is designed with a void between them; there will be a structural space frame system that will span the hulls. The rest of the interior volume will be filled with water that will act as the cosmic radiation shield and also the water reservoir for the station.<br /><br />
<h2>Ballistic Protection</h2>
The water-filled void of the double wall system will act as the last line of defense for the station to protect against the potential of ballistic penetrations from space debris that are moving at relatively high velocities. The outer hull will be composed of layers of material that will be several meters thick; this will be the first line of defense for ballistic protection.<br /><br />
<h2>Thermal Protection</h2>
The outer hull and the water-filled void between the inner and outer hull will act as a thermal insulator from the temperature extremes of outer space.<br /><br />
<h2>Large Interior Volume</h2>
The interior of the Gaia class vehicle is designed to be reconfigurable within the structure's bulkheads. The bulkheads allow for structural compartmentalization that creates a level of safety required for large space-faring vehicles. A modular panel system is used for the floors and walls within the bulkhead zones. These panels are structural, but in addition they also contain electrical, data, fresh water and waste water systems within the panel. The panels will also have integrated lighting, heating/cooling system in addition to a variety of sensors that when integrated together will monitor all critical life/safety systems throughout the station.</div>
