<h1>Why go to space?</h1>
<br />Earth is a finite place, but human populations are continuing to grow. The resources to sustain the population are being used up at an ever increasing rate. Eventually there will not be enough resources to go around.<br /><br />Phosphorus is one of these resources that are being used up. Phosphorus is just as important to agriculture as water. But a lack of availability and accessibility of phosphorus is an emerging problem that threatens our capacity to feed the global population. Like nitrogen and potassium, it is a nutrient that plants take up from the soil and it is crucial to soil fertility and crop growth. Unless something is done, the scarcity of phosphorous will cause problems of a global dimension. As early as 2035 it is calculated that the demand for phosphorus may outpace the supply. Phosphorous is extracted from phosphate rock, a non-renewable resource that is used almost exclusively in agriculture. The demand for phosphorus has increased and prices soared by 800 percent between 2006 and 2008.<br /><br />Phosphorus is just one critical non-renewable resource that we require. If humans are going to continue to increase in number then we will need to expand to where there are more resources.<br /><br />Space is a vastly large and uninhabited place. Space has far greater quantities of all the material and energy resources required to sustain human life. If humans wish to continue to grow in number, then living in space is the only direction to go in. Eventually more humans will live in space than on earth. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
